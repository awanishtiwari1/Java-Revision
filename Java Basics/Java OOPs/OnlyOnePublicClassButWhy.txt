Why Java has only one public class ??


1. Main method should be inside the public class.
2. public class name should be same as filename.

=> Since JVM calls the main method which is static, which means it can be access using classname.(dot) and 
classname should be public so that it can be accessed outside and JVM can access it.

=>  As we already know execution starts from main method, Since a java program can have n number of java classes, so how the compiler would get to 
    know that in which claa the main method is, so to let the compiler know that main method is 
    present in this public class we use to keep filename same as public class in java.
