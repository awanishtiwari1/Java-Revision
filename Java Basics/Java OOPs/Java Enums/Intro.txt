Enum classes has collections of constants
Its constants are static and final (Internally)
It can not extend any java classes as Internally it extends java.lanf.Enum
It can implement interfaces 
it can have variables and constructors 
It can not be instantiated (as its constructor is private only, even if u give default 
in byte code it will mark it as private
)
No other clss can extend Enum class 
It can have abstract method and all the constant should implement that 
abstract method.


The Major concern is here why to use ENUM what is the benefit od the same when
we can create constant through static and final keyword.


answer -> For better readability and full control over the values passed 
int the parameter , we can restrict the user to pass a parameter within 
a range of values, but this would not be [possible] in case we are using 
static fianl to an instance variables of a class user can pass anything and has 
no over it.
