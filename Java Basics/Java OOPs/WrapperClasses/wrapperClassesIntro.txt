Definition 
A wrapper class is a class which converts primitive data type to Object known as Autoboxing and vice 
versa is known as Unboxing.

8 primitive data types we hve 
int,char,short,byte,long,double,float,boolean.

Integer, Character, Short, Byte , Long , Double , Float, Boolean 

So, the question is why to use/ why we need Wrapper classes???
-> Since Java does not support call by reference, so if one will pass a primitive
    data type into a method and do some modification to that then after the method call
    the value will be vanished since primitive data stored in stack.


-> All the Java Collection framework DS supports only objects not primitive data types so we 
    use wrapper classes.
