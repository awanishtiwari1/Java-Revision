1. These methods are associated with the class 
2. can be called with classname .
3. static methods can not access non static instance variables and methods.
4. Static methods can not be overridden.




When to declare a method static ??

-> Methods which do not modify the state of the object can be declared as static.
-> Utility method which do not use any instance variables and computes only on Arguments.


Why we can't access non static variables from a static method ??
-> Since static variables are associated with class and non static variables differs/different 
    for each object, so it will not be able to call, that's why we call static variables from static
    methods.


Why Static method can't be overridded ??


Since Java creates only one copy of Static variables/method, even if we are writing the 
implementation of a method in child class using @Override annotation then, to us it seems that 
method is overridden but in actual it is overhidden, because static methods can be called using 
classname.method()



Note -> Static methods can be overloaded.
